Land Recognition

I acknowledge that my work takes place on unceded Indigenous lands. The Kanien'kéha Nation are recognized as the stewards of the land known as Tiohtià:ke or Montreal. The Haundenosaunee Confederacy, of which the Kanien'kéha Nation is a part, and the Anishinaabeg peoples have strong historical ties to the area. Today, it is home to a diverse population of Indigenous and other peoples. I invite you to take a moment to reflect on whose land you are living and working on, and if you don’t know, to research and reflect.
