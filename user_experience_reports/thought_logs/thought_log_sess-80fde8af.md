# Oscar's Thought Log - Session sess-80fde8af

## Step 1: Navigate to Kontakt
### Internal Monologue
> Thinking: Right, let's see how GreenCycle talks about their mission. Architects love a good mission statement—if it's not just fluff. Wait, what's this grey box? Cookies. Again. "Zustimmen," yeah, yeah, I just want to see the page.

### Decision Rationale
Need to clear the compliance barrier to access the navigation menu.

---

## Step 2: Find Support Info
### Internal Monologue
> Thinking: service@greencycle.de. Standard. 07:00 to 17:00? At least they start early. I appreciate a company that respects the early morning grind, like my 6 AM jogs with Bruno.

### Decision Rationale
Looking for direct communication channels to assess responsiveness.

---

## Step 3: Product Catalog
### Internal Monologue
> Thinking: "Tätigkeitsfelder"... that's a mouthful. It's very... corporate. Where are the actual products? I see "Entsorgungseinkauf" and "Vermarktung." This feels more like a brochure for a waste plant than a catalog for an architect looking for sustainable materials.

### Decision Rationale
Searching for "standard elements" or "products" as per professional needs.

---

## Step 4: Sustainability Certifications
### Internal Monologue
> Thinking: ISO 14001, 50001. Good. They've done their homework. But why are these all hidden at the bottom? If I were designing this, I'd put the certificates right next to the "About Us" section. It's about building trust, people!

### Decision Rationale
Verifying corporate values through official certifications.

---

## Step 5: Add to Cart (Attempt)
### Internal Monologue
> Thinking: Where is the cart? Am I on the wrong site? "Add three sustainable design products"... I can't even find one product with a price tag. It's all "Consultancy." This is a major disconnect. John (my boss) would hate this—he wants to see costs, not "let's talk."

### Decision Rationale
Trying to follow the task of "purchasing" to test the conversion flow. Failure is a major finding.

---

## Step 6: Search 'Recycled Materials'
### Internal Monologue
> Thinking: Let's use the search. "Recycled materials." The results are just links to the same three pages I've already seen. It's like a circular argument. Very appropriate for a recycling company, I suppose.

### Decision Rationale
Testing the internal search engine's efficiency in surfacing specific content.

---

## Step 10: Social Media
### Internal Monologue
> Thinking: LinkedIn. Xing. Professional. No Instagram? Maybe they don't think recycling is "aesthetic" enough. I could show them some modernist recycling centers in Copenhagen that would change their minds.

### Decision Rationale
Checking brand presence and community engagement channels.
