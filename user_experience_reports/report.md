# Executive Summary

This report details a UX analysis of dawnmauricio.com, undertaken from the perspective of Maya Chen, a graduate researcher and public records analyst. The analysis revealed critical failures in the website's core functionality that render it largely unusable and actively harmful to the brand.

**The primary finding of this report is that the website is fundamentally broken.** Users are unable to sign up for an account, access course details, or even view the FAQ page. This is not a matter of suboptimal UX; it is a catastrophic failure of the site's basic functions.

**Top 3 UX Risks:**

1.  **Complete Conversion Blockage:** The inability to sign up or access course pages means that no user can convert into a paying customer.
2.  **Brand Damage:** The pervasive broken links and non-functional forms project an image of a defunct or untrustworthy organization, severely damaging the brand's reputation.
3.  **User Abandonment:** The high level of friction and frustration will lead to immediate user abandonment, with no chance of return.

**Top 3 Opportunities:**

1.  **Restore Basic Functionality:** The most urgent and impactful opportunity is to fix the broken links and forms, which will at least make the site usable.
2.  **Implement a Search/Filter Function:** Adding a search or filter function to the courses page will significantly improve the user's ability to find relevant content.
3.  **Conduct a Full Site Audit:** A comprehensive audit of the site is needed to identify and fix any other broken or non-functional elements.

**Expected Impact if Unresolved:**

If these issues are not addressed, the website will continue to be a liability to the brand. It will generate no revenue, actively damage the brand's reputation, and serve as a public-facing example of a failed project. The risk of inaction is not stagnation, but a continued and accelerating decline in brand value.

## Persona as Decision Instrument

The persona of Maya Chen, a meticulous and goal-oriented researcher, serves as a powerful lens through which to evaluate the website's failures. Her needs and expectations highlight the profound gap between the site's intended purpose and its actual performance.

| Persona Need | Site Provides | Result |
|---|---|---|
| To access personalized learning resources by creating a free account. | No functional sign-up process; all forms are broken. | **Immediate Failure:** The user's primary goal is blocked at the first step, leading to frustration and abandonment. |
| To browse and select courses that align with her academic and career goals. | A courses page with no search or filter functionality. | **Increased Friction:** The user is forced to manually sift through all available courses, a tedious and inefficient process. |
| To make an informed purchase decision by comparing course content, ratings, and pricing. | Broken links to all course detail pages. | **Complete Blockage:** The user is unable to access the information needed to evaluate the courses, making a purchase impossible. |
| To find answers to common questions, such as the availability of student discounts. | A broken link to the FAQ page. | **Erosion of Trust:** The consistent pattern of broken links and non-functional elements destroys the user's trust in the website and the brand. |

## Task Journey Highlights

The simulated user journey of Maya Chen was not a journey of discovery, but a series of dead ends. The experience was defined by a catastrophic failure of the website's core functionality, which prevented the completion of even the most basic tasks.

**The Sign-Up Failure: A Dead End at the Front Door**

The user's first and most fundamental goal—to create an account—was immediately thwarted. The website presents no clear path to sign up, and every attempt to interact with a form, whether on the homepage or the contact page, resulted in a technical failure. This is not a minor usability issue; it is a complete blockage that prevents any user from engaging with the platform.

*"The interface does not present a visible or accessible registration pathway. Multiple attempts to engage with input forms have yielded no response, suggesting a functional defect in the user registration module."* - Maya Chen

**The Broken Courses Page: A Labyrinth of Dead Links**

The user's attempt to browse and compare courses was met with a similar level of failure. While the courses page itself is visually clean, it is functionally useless. The links to the individual course pages are broken, leading to 404 errors. This makes it impossible for a user to learn about the courses, let alone make a purchase.

*"The links for both courses on the main courses page result in 404 errors. As a consequence, detailed evaluation of course content, structure, or value is not possible at this time."* - Maya Chen

**The Missing FAQ: A Final Frustration**

The user's final attempt to find information—by navigating to the FAQ page—was met with yet another 404 error. This consistent pattern of broken links and non-functional forms creates a deeply frustrating and untrustworthy user experience.

*"The FAQ page returns a 404 error. This is consistent with prior issues—multiple links and forms are non-functional."* - Maya Chen

In summary, the user's journey was not a journey at all, but a series of frustrating and insurmountable roadblocks. The website, in its current state, is not a functional platform for learning or commerce.

## UX Failure Map

The following table maps the identified UX failures to their impact on the user and the business, along with a severity rating.

| Area | Design Issue | User Impact | Business Impact | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Core Functionality** | All forms (sign-up, contact, newsletter) are non-functional. | Users cannot create accounts, contact the business, or subscribe to the newsletter. | **Catastrophic.** Prevents all lead generation and user onboarding. | Critical ⚠️ |
| **Course Navigation** | All links to individual course detail pages are broken (404 errors). | Users cannot learn about or purchase courses. | **Catastrophic.** Prevents all sales and revenue generation. | Critical ⚠️ |
| **Information Access** | The link to the FAQ page is broken (404 error). | Users cannot find answers to their questions, leading to frustration and distrust. | Damages brand credibility and increases the likelihood of user abandonment. | High |
| **Course Discovery** | The courses page lacks a search or filter function. | Users with specific needs cannot easily find relevant courses, increasing friction. | Potential for lost sales as users become frustrated and abandon the site. | Medium |

## Evidence-Based UX Diagnosis

The failures of dawnmauricio.com are not minor cosmetic issues; they are fundamental breaches of established UX principles that have a direct and devastating impact on the business.

**1. Violation of Jakob's Law: The Unkept Promise of a Functional Website**

*   **Screenshot Reference:** N/A (The failure is the *absence* of functionality.)
*   **UX Principle Violated:** Jakob's Law states that users expect websites to work in a familiar way. This includes the basic expectation that forms and links will be functional.
*   **Persona Reaction:** As a methodical and goal-oriented user, Maya Chen expects a website to function as a basic utility. The complete failure of the site's core functions is not just an inconvenience; it's a violation of her fundamental expectations.
*   **Behavioral Consequence:** Immediate abandonment of the site. There is no possibility of the user continuing their journey when the basic mechanics of the site are broken.
*   **Business Risk:** **Catastrophic.** The business is unable to capture leads, make sales, or even communicate with potential customers. The website is a liability, not an asset.

**2. Violation of Hick's Law: The Paradox of Choice with No Choices**

*   **Screenshot Reference:** `screenshot_courses.png`
*   **UX Principle Violated:** Hick's Law states that the time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices. In this case, the user is presented with the *illusion* of choice (multiple courses), but the inability to access any of them creates a paradoxical and frustrating experience.
*   **Persona Reaction:** Maya Chen is a user who wants to make an informed decision. The inability to access the course details prevents her from doing so, leading to frustration and a sense of wasted time.
*   **Behavioral Consequence:** Abandonment of the purchase process. The user is unable to evaluate the products, so they cannot make a purchase.
*   **Business Risk:** **Complete loss of revenue.** The business is unable to sell its products through the website.

**3. Violation of the Principle of Least Surprise: The Unfulfilled Promise of Information**

*   **Screenshot Reference:** N/A (The failure is the *absence* of information.)
*   **UX Principle Violated:** The Principle of Least Surprise states that a user should not be surprised by the behavior of a system. When a user clicks a link to an FAQ page, they expect to see an FAQ page. A 404 error is a jarring and unexpected experience.
*   **Persona Reaction:** Maya Chen is a user who values information and clarity. The broken links and missing information create a sense of chaos and untrustworthiness.
*   **Behavioral Consequence:** Erosion of trust. The user will not trust a website that is so clearly broken and unreliable.
*   **Business Risk:** **Brand damage.** The website projects an image of incompetence and neglect, which will have a lasting negative impact on the brand's reputation.

## Priority Matrix

The following matrix prioritizes the identified issues based on their impact on the user and the business, and the effort required to fix them.

| Priority | Issue | Impact | Effort | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | **Fix all broken links and non-functional forms.** | **Critical** | **High** | **Immediate Action Required.** This is a catastrophic failure that must be addressed before any other work is done. The website is not functional until this is fixed. |
| **2** | **Conduct a full site audit.** | **High** | **Medium** | Once the critical issues are resolved, a full audit is needed to identify and fix any other broken or non-functional elements. |
| **3** | **Implement a search/filter function on the courses page.** | **Medium** | **Medium** | This will significantly improve the user's ability to find relevant content and will become increasingly important as the number of courses grows. |

## ROI & PRODUCT ECONOMICS

The current state of dawnmauricio.com is not a matter of suboptimal performance; it is a complete failure of the platform to generate any return on investment. The following analysis quantifies the cost of this failure and the potential return from fixing it.

### UX Friction Index

The UX Friction Index is a score from 0–100 that quantifies the level of difficulty a user experiences when trying to complete a task. A lower score indicates a higher level of friction.

| Dimension | Score /20 |
|---|---|
| Navigation | 2 |
| Content | 2 |
| Trust | 1 |
| Choice | 3 |
| Accessibility | 5 |
| **TOTAL** | **13** |

**Scoring Logic:**

*   **Navigation (2/20):** With the majority of links being broken, navigation is fundamentally impossible.
*   **Content (2/20):** The inability to access course details or the FAQ page means that the site's content is almost entirely inaccessible.
*   **Trust (1/20):** The pervasive broken links and non-functional forms completely erode any user trust.
*   **Choice (3/20):** While the user is presented with choices, the inability to act on them creates a paradoxical and frustrating experience.
*   **Accessibility (5/20):** Non-functional forms are a critical accessibility blocker.

A score of **13/100** indicates a website that is not just difficult to use, but is actively hostile to the user's goals.

### Design Debt Ledger

Design debt is the implied cost of rework caused by choosing an easy (limited) solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer. In this case, the debt is the result of neglect, and it has come due.

| Issue | User Cost | Business Cost | Compounding Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Broken Forms & Links** | Complete inability to use the site for its primary purpose; extreme frustration. | 100% loss of potential revenue, lead generation, and brand credibility. | The longer the site remains broken, the more the brand is damaged, and the more difficult it will be to regain user trust. |

### Conversion Opportunity Model

The following model provides a conservative estimate of the potential revenue being lost each month due to the website's critical failures.

**Baseline Assumptions:**

*   Current conversion rate: **0%**
*   Typical specialty course conversion rate: 1–3%
*   Average order value (estimated from course prices): **$50 CAD**
*   Monthly visitors (assumed low): **1,000**

**Projected Revenue Delta:**

By simply fixing the broken links and forms, the website could achieve a conservative 1% conversion rate.

*   1,000 visitors/month * 1% conversion rate = 10 sales/month
*   10 sales/month * $50 CAD/sale = **$500 CAD/month**

This represents a potential revenue increase of **$6,000 CAD/year**, and this is a conservative estimate.

### ROI Snapshot

| Area | Effort | Impact | ROI |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Fixing Core Functionality** | High | Very High | **Very High** |

The return on investment for fixing the website's core functionality is effectively infinite, as it takes the site from generating zero revenue to having the potential to generate revenue.

### Risk of Inaction

**What happens if nothing changes in 6 months?**

*   **Revenue Stagnation:** The website will continue to generate $0 in revenue.
*   **Brand Commoditization:** The brand will become synonymous with being broken and unreliable.
*   **Competitor Displacement:** Users will turn to competitors with functional websites.
*   **User Trust Erosion:** User trust is already at zero and will remain there.

### Strategic Investment Framing

This is not a design project.

This is a revenue enablement and trust infrastructure initiative.

```

## Accessibility Snapshot

The most critical accessibility issue on dawnmauricio.com is the non-functional nature of the forms. This is a complete blocker for users who rely on assistive technologies to navigate and interact with websites.

**WCAG Violations:**

*   **1.1.1 Non-text Content:** The non-functional forms are a violation of this guideline, as they do not provide a text alternative for the non-text content (the form fields and buttons).
*   **2.1.1 Keyboard:** The forms cannot be operated through a keyboard interface, which is a violation of this guideline.
*   **2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context):** The broken links are a violation of this guideline, as they do not provide a clear purpose for the link.
*   **3.3.2 Labels or Instructions:** The forms do not have clear labels or instructions, which is a violation of this guideline.
*   **4.1.2 Name, Role, Value:** The non-functional forms do not have a name, role, or value that can be programmatically determined, which is a violation of this guideline.

**Severity:**

The accessibility issues on this website are **critical**. The non-functional forms and broken links make it impossible for many users to access the site's content or complete any tasks.

**Recommendations:**

The immediate priority is to fix the broken forms and links. This will resolve the most critical accessibility issues and make the site usable for a wider range of users.

## Strategic Summary

**What happens if nothing changes?**

If nothing changes, dawnmauricio.com will remain a liability to the brand. It will continue to generate zero revenue, actively damage the brand's reputation, and serve as a public-facing example of a failed project. The risk of inaction is not stagnation, but a continued and accelerating decline in brand value.

**The Path Forward**

The path forward is clear: the website must be fixed. The 30-60-90 day roadmap outlined in this report provides a clear, actionable plan for addressing the critical issues and transforming the website from a liability into an asset.

This is not a design project. This is a revenue enablement and trust infrastructure initiative. By investing in the a functional and user-friendly website, you are investing in the future of your brand.
