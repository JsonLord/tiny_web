TASK: Sign up for a free account.

OBSERVATION: The interface does not present a visible or accessible registration pathway. Multiple attempts to engage with input forms have yielded no response, suggesting a functional defect in the user registration module.

ASSESSMENT: Account creation is currently non-operational. This impedes user onboarding and limits access to account-dependent features.

ACTION: Record the issue for tracking. Redirect focus to executable tasks that do not require authentication.

TASK: Review available online courses.

INTERNAL THOUGHTS: The courses page is well-organized and straightforward to navigate. However, the absence of a search or filtering option presents a practical limitation. As the catalog expands, locating specific content—such as courses on emotional intelligence and active listening, which Maya is seeking—becomes increasingly inefficient. This is not a critical failure, but it does introduce friction for targeted exploration.

DECISION: I will note the missing search functionality for future consideration. For now, I will proceed by examining two relevant courses in detail, comparing their structure and content to assess suitability.

TASK: Compare two courses.

INTERNAL THOUGHTS: The link to the Awaken Presence course returns a 404 error. This prevents access to essential information and may affect user confidence in the site's reliability. The issue has been noted for follow-up.

DECISION: The broken link has been recorded. Next, I will proceed to the second course page using direct navigation to ensure the comparison can continue with available resources.
``````
TASK: Compare two courses.

OBSERVATION: The links for both courses on the main courses page result in 404 errors. As a consequence, detailed evaluation of course content, structure, or value is not possible at this time. Access to the intended pages is a prerequisite for meaningful comparison.

ASSESSMENT: Since neither course can be viewed, the user journey is blocked at an early stage. This limits the ability to proceed with informed decision-making or further assessment.

ACTION: Document the inaccessibility of both course pages as a critical barrier. Proceed to the next task that remains viable under current conditions.

TASK: Search the FAQ section for a student discount code.

OBSERVATION: The FAQ page returns a 404 error. This is consistent with prior issues—multiple links and forms are non-functional.

ACTION: Document the issue. Conclude the simulation.
NOTE: The website’s current state prevents meaningful evaluation beyond the landing page. Core functionality is compromised.
