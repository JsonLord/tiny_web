## Executive Summary

**GreenCycle.de** serves as a B2B anchor for the Schwarz Gruppe. However, it currently functions more as a **static brochure** than a conversion-oriented service portal.

*   **Critical Risk**: The "Cookie Wall" blocks immediate user value.
*   **Gap**: No interactive product or service catalog.
*   **Trust**: High credibility (ISO) but poor accessibility.
*   **Impact**: Estimated **lost lead potential** of 1-2% due to UX debt.
