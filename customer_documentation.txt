Oh, this is much better! I'm on a new website now, and it's much easier to find my way around. I'm trying to find the events, and I think I've found them.

I went straight to the events page, and there's a nice, clear list of upcoming events. It's not too cluttered, and I can see the dates and what the events are about. It's so much easier to read than that other website. I'm so glad I found this one. I can actually see what's going on! I'll have a good look through this list and see if there's anything I'd like to go to.
