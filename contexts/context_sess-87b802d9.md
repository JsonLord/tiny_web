## Tasks
[
  "Visit the homepage and identify **at least 3** distinct branding elements (e.g., color schemes, logo placements, slogans) that signal Bauhaus\u2019 core brand messaging. Note how these elements align with their \u2018comfort in creation\u2019 or functional/aesthetic design tagline.",
  "Find the **\u2018About Us\u2019** or **\u2018Story\u2019** section (if available in the footer or main menu) and summarize Bauhaus\u2019 brand identity in **1-2 sentences** own words. Check if the language evokes trust, craftsmanship, or emotional connection (e.g., heritage, community).",
  "Navigate to the **\u2018Crafted for You\u2019** section or landing page targeting hobbyists (e.g., DIYers) and evaluate how Bauhaus communicates **emotional benefits** (e.g., \u2018achoevable results\u2019) vs. purely functional features (e.g., product specs).",
  "Locate the **\u2018Trade & Professional\u2019** section and contrast its brand tone/communication with the consumer section. Assess whether professionals encounter jargon-heavy messaging or simplified clarity\u2014note how this influences perceived expertise or approachability.",
  "Search for **\u2018eco-friendly\u2019** or **\u2018sustainable material\u2019** products (e.g., tools with recycled steel) and analyze how Bauhaus integrates this messaging in product listings: salary savings<ed ingredients, green icons, or environmental promises? How emotionally compelling is this appeal?",
  "Find a **product line** (e.g., drills, paint, outdoor equipment) and identify **one brand hydration moment** (e.g., packaging, video, infographics) that makes the product tangible. Describe whether humor, storytelling, or aesthetic glossy fits Bauhaus\u2019 brand voice.",
  "Sort through a category like **\u2018Outdoor & Garden\u2019** and pick a competing product (e.g., a different brand\u2019s chair vs. Bauhaus\u2019). Contrast how Bauhaus\u2019 design, product descriptions, or star ratings steer your **purchase decision** compared to alternatives.",
  "Use the live chat feature (if available under support or purchases) or the \u2018Ask a Question\u2019 form to simulate caring for an item like a **cordless drill**. Document thelanguage used: Is it technical, friendly, or exploratory? Does it reinforce Bauhaus\u2019 brand warmth or efficiency?",
  "Find a **user-generated content** hub, testimonial section, or social media card embedded on Bauhaus\u2019 site (e.g., YouTube videos, customer photo galleries). Explain which elements (e.g., peer praise, lifestyles, reviews) most effectively elicited **trust** or **desire** among users.",
  "Navigate to the **checkout or loyalty program** page. Critique how Bauhaus signals its brand\u2019s commitments beyond sales (e.g., subscriptions, warranty support). Determine if messaging focuses on **tangible perks**, **community bonds** (e.g., maker projects), or **legacy value**."
