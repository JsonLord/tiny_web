        "thoughts": "\nI've corrected the URL and successfully extracted the text from the page. After reviewing the content, it's clear there's no 'Our Story,' 'About Us,' or 'Origin' section. The text is minimal and focuses entirely on the menu, location, and opening hours. This is consistent with the homepage's lack of narrative. I cannot find a story about a coffee-growing region or a specific farmer, which is the core of Task 2. My only option is to document this absence and reflect on how it impacts my perception of the brand.\n",
        "decision": "\nI will log this interaction, noting the lack of an 'Our Story' section. I will then write a reflection from my persona's perspective, explaining how the absence of any narrative or connection to the coffee's origin deepens the sense of alienation and fails to build an emotional connection with the brand. I will then style this reflection and append it to the report. Since I have exhausted all options for finding this information, I will consider Task 2 complete and move on to Task 3.\n"

    "reflection": "\nThe search for a narrative, for a thread connecting this cup to a person or a place, has led to a dead end. There is no 'Our Story' or 'Origin Journey.' The website is a digital menu, nothing more. It tells me what I can buy, but not why I should care. The absence of a story about a featured farmer or cooperative is a significant omission. It reinforces the feeling that this is a place of transaction, not connection. I can't connect with a farmer's story because there isn't one being told. This silence speaks volumes. It suggests that the people behind the coffee are invisible, their labor unacknowledged. For me, a coffee's story is as important as its flavor profile. Without it, the experience feels hollow, another anonymous commodity in a busy marketplace. This lack of narrative depth makes it impossible for me to form any emotional connection with the brand.\n"
